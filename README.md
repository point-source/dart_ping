## Dart Ping

dart_ping is a multi-platform network ping utility for Dart applications.

It is available for use via the [pub.dev package repository](https://pub.dev/packages/dart_ping)

### iOS Compatibility

In order to provide compatibility on iOS (via Flutter Method Channels) while retaining native dart support, the package is split into two parts:

[dart_ping](dart_ping) is the main package which supports Windows, Mac, Linux, and Android natively without additional binaries

[dart_ping_ios](dart_ping_ios) is a plugin which adds cocoa dependencies to support ping on iOS systems. Using this plugin requires the Flutter SDK to be added to your dart project.
