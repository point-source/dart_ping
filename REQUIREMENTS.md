# Requirements

This document tracks two areas of work:

1. **iOS SPM migration (#73)** — *shipped in `dart_ping_ios` 5.0.0.*
   Replace the `flutter_icmp_ping` dependency with a native Swift ICMP
   engine and ship under Swift Package Manager. Captured in the
   `§req:problem-statement` … `§req:priorities` sections below.
2. **Maintenance & modernization refresh** — a cross-package pass to bring
   dependencies, SDK constraints, documentation, and test coverage current,
   and to surface bugs / security flaws / improvements across the Dart and
   native Swift code. Captured in the `§req:refresh-*` sections at the end.

## Problem statement §req:problem-statement

The target users are Flutter app developers who use `dart_ping` for
network ping on iOS and who have enabled (or want to enable) Flutter's
Swift Package Manager (SPM) build mode.

These developers cannot consume `dart_ping_ios` under SPM. The iOS
support package carries no native iOS code of its own — it is a thin
Dart wrapper that delegates to the third-party `flutter_icmp_ping`
plugin, which ships only a CocoaPods podspec. On an SPM-only project
there is no path to add iOS ping support, and the maintainer cannot fix
it directly because the native code lives in a dependency they do not
control.

Current solutions fall short because Flutter is moving toward SPM as the
default iOS/macOS build system and CocoaPods is on a deprecation path.
New Flutter projects increasingly default to SPM, so a growing share of
users find `dart_ping`'s iOS story broken. The problem is therefore
growing rather than static: it gets worse as Flutter's SPM adoption
rises.

Separately, the existing iOS path has drifted from the other platforms.
The `ttl` parameter is ignored, TTL-exceeded errors (recently fixed on
Android in #49) never surface on iOS, several error types are unmapped,
and the iOS summary omits the per-run error list. So iOS already behaves
differently from Android/Linux/macOS/Windows even before SPM enters the
picture.

Direction agreed with the maintainer (recorded here as the framing for
everything downstream): replace the `flutter_icmp_ping` dependency with a
native Swift ICMP implementation owned by this repository, shipped as a
true federated plugin with SPM support. This both unblocks SPM and gives
the maintainer control to close the parity gaps.

## Success criteria §req:success-criteria

- A Flutter app with SPM enabled and **no CocoaPods/Podfile present** can
  add `dart_ping_ios` and run network pings on iOS, producing correct
  per-probe responses and a run summary. *(must-have)*
- The example app runs on an iOS simulator or device with SPM enabled,
  no `Podfile`, and ping works end-to-end. *(primary acceptance test)*
- The new iOS implementation has **no dependency on `flutter_icmp_ping`**
  or any other CocoaPods-only package; the native ping logic lives in
  this repository as Swift.
- iOS reaches behavioral parity with the other platforms:
  - honors the `ttl` parameter (limits the number of network hops);
  - emits `timeToLiveExceeded` events when a hop limit is exceeded;
  - surfaces the full error set the other platforms report
    (`timeToLiveExceeded`, `requestTimedOut`, `unknownHost`, `noReply`,
    `unknown`);
  - includes the per-run error list in the summary.
- App developers do not have to add special entitlements or take extra
  App Store review steps to use it. *(soft — to confirm during `/plan`)*
- Automated tests cover the iOS ping behavior where feasible.
- Existing CocoaPods-based consumers are unaffected: the prior
  `dart_ping_ios` release remains usable for projects that have not
  migrated to SPM.

## User stories §req:user-stories

- As a Flutter developer building an iOS app with SPM enabled, I want to
  add `dart_ping_ios` and ping a host so that I get round-trip responses
  and a summary **without installing CocoaPods**.
- As a developer pinging from iOS, I want to set a TTL and receive a
  "time-to-live exceeded" event so that I can build traceroute-style
  diagnostics, the same way I can on Android, Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- As a cross-platform developer, I want iOS errors (timeout, unknown
  host, no reply, TTL exceeded, unknown) and the summary's error list to
  match the other platforms so that my shared code handles failures
  identically everywhere.
- As an existing user who has not migrated to SPM, I want my current
  CocoaPods-based setup to keep working on the previous version so that
  the migration happens on my schedule, not as a forced break.
- As the package maintainer, I want the iOS native code to live in this
  repository so that I can fix bugs and add features without waiting on
  an upstream third-party package.

## Quality attributes §req:quality-attributes

- **Compatibility:** works under Flutter's Swift Package Manager build
  mode. CocoaPods support is dropped in the new version (SPM-only). iOS
  only — macOS continues to be served natively by the core `dart_ping`.
  The minimum supported iOS version is not yet decided and will be set in
  `/plan`.
- **Parity / reliability:** observable behavior — responses, summary,
  errors, and accepted parameters — matches the other platforms.
- **Security / permissions:** should not require special entitlements or
  unusual App Store review steps from the consuming app. *(to confirm in
  `/plan`)*
- **Testability:** behavior is verifiable via the example app on iOS and,
  where feasible, via automated tests.
- **Accuracy:** round-trip timing is comparable to the previous
  `flutter_icmp_ping`-based implementation.

## Constraints §req:constraints

- Native iOS ping is implemented in **Swift**, owned in this repository,
  replacing the `flutter_icmp_ping` dependency.
- Distribution is **SPM-only** for the new version; no podspec ships with
  it. Existing CocoaPods consumers remain on the prior `dart_ping_ios`
  release.
- The public Dart API — the `Ping` interface and the
  `PingData` / `PingResponse` / `PingSummary` / `PingError` shapes — is
  unchanged, so existing app code keeps working without edits.
- This is a breaking change and ships as a **new major version** of
  `dart_ping_ios`.
- Scope is **iOS only**.

## Priorities §req:priorities

- **Must-have (non-negotiable):** SPM works at all. An SPM-enabled app
  can use `dart_ping_ios` on iOS with no CocoaPods, backed by a native
  Swift implementation and with no `flutter_icmp_ping` dependency. This is
  the minimum bar for shipping.
- **High priority (strong follow-on, same effort):** iOS feature parity —
  honor `ttl`, emit `timeToLiveExceeded`, cover the full error set, and
  include errors in the summary. Worth doing now that the maintainer owns
  the native code, but secondary to "SPM works at all."
- **Nice-to-have:** automated iOS tests; a documented minimum iOS version
  and entitlement guidance for app developers.

# Maintenance & modernization refresh

A periodic health pass over both packages — `dart_ping` (core) and
`dart_ping_ios` (the native Swift / SPM iOS plugin). Not tied to a single
GitHub issue; the driver is accumulated drift, not a new feature.

## Refresh — problem statement §req:refresh-problem-statement

The target users are existing consumers of `dart_ping` / `dart_ping_ios`
and the package maintainer. Both packages have drifted from current Dart /
Flutter tooling:

- **Dependencies are behind.** Direct dev-dependencies in particular are
  stale — `lints` is pinned at `^2.0.0` while `6.x` is resolvable,
  `flutter_lints` at `^2.0.1` vs `6.0.0`, and `test` is locked well below
  its resolvable `1.31`. `js` (transitive) is discontinued. Consumers
  resolving fresh see old, sometimes superseded, packages.
- **The SDK floor is conservative.** Both packages allow `sdk: ">=3.0.0"`,
  which blocks adoption of newer lint rules and language conveniences that
  the current toolchain (Dart 3.12 / Flutter 3.44) offers.
- **Docs have drifted.** The root `README` predates the native-Swift iOS
  rewrite (5.0.0); package READMEs, CHANGELOGs, and dartdoc may not reflect
  current platform support, the SPM-only iOS story, or recently fixed
  behavior.
- **Test coverage is uneven.** `dart_ping` has known *failing* tests
  (the macOS and Windows "TTL Exceeded" parse cases crash because the
  regex lacks a `seq` capture group), and several behaviors — parser error
  paths, the iOS event mapper, stream lifecycle — are thinly covered.
- **Config has gone stale.** Both `analysis_options.yaml` files still
  configure `dart_code_metrics`, which is no longer part of the lints
  toolchain and is effectively dead config.
- **The native Swift code has never had a focused audit.** The iOS ICMP
  engine (socket setup, ICMP packet construction/parsing, buffer bounds,
  error mapping) is new and owned in-repo but has not been reviewed for
  bugs or security flaws.

Left alone, this drift compounds: each release gets harder to cut,
consumers on current SDKs hit avoidable friction, and undiscovered defects
(especially in the new native code) ship unnoticed.

## Refresh — success criteria §req:refresh-success-criteria

Observable, verifiable outcomes:

- **Dependencies current.** `dart pub outdated` (and `flutter pub outdated`
  for the iOS package) shows every *direct* dependency at its latest
  resolvable version, including the `lints` 6 / `flutter_lints` 6 majors.
  `dart pub get` / `flutter pub get` resolve cleanly in both packages.
  *(must-have)*
- **Static analysis is clean.** `dart analyze` (core) and `flutter analyze`
  (iOS) report **zero** issues under the upgraded lint rule sets.
  *(must-have)*
- **SDK floor raised only as far as it pays for itself.** The `sdk`
  constraint is bumped to the lowest stable version that the upgraded
  tooling (lints 6, test 1.31) and any adopted language features actually
  require — and no further. The chosen floor and its justification are
  recorded in the CHANGELOG. *(must-have)*
- **All tests pass.** `dart test` passes fully in `dart_ping` and
  `dart_ping_ios` with **no known-failing or skipped cases** — including
  the previously-crashing macOS/Windows "TTL Exceeded" parse tests.
  *(must-have)*
- **Coverage gaps filled.** Thinly covered behavior — parser error/edge
  paths, the iOS event mapper, and stream start/stop lifecycle — gains
  tests. (Goal is to close obvious gaps, not hit a numeric threshold, and
  no CI is introduced in this pass.)
- **Docs accurate.** The root `README`, both package `README`s,
  `CHANGELOG`s, and public dartdoc reflect current reality: supported
  platforms, the SPM-only native-Swift iOS implementation (5.0.0), the
  current SDK floor, and recently fixed behavior. A new reader can install
  and use each package from the docs without hitting a stale instruction.
- **Audit findings surfaced.** A review of the Dart code (both packages)
  **and** the native Swift ICMP engine produces an enumerated list of
  bugs, security flaws, and improvement opportunities, each triaged
  (fix-now / defer / won't-fix). Security-relevant Swift findings — socket
  configuration, ICMP packet parsing, buffer bounds, untrusted-input
  handling — are explicitly assessed.

## Refresh — user stories §req:refresh-user-stories

- As a consumer on a current Dart/Flutter SDK, I want `pub get` to resolve
  up-to-date dependencies and `analyze` to pass, so that adding these
  packages doesn't drag stale or discontinued transitive deps into my app.
- As a maintainer cutting the next release, I want a green `dart test` with
  no known-failing cases, so that I can release with confidence instead of
  mentally excusing "expected" failures.
- As a developer reading the docs, I want the README and CHANGELOG to
  describe the *current* iOS implementation (native Swift, SPM-only) and
  supported platforms, so that I don't follow instructions for a version
  that no longer exists.
- As a security-conscious adopter, I want the native iOS ICMP code to have
  been reviewed for socket and packet-parsing flaws, so that I can trust it
  with untrusted network input.
- As the maintainer, I want a triaged list of bugs and improvements across
  both packages, so that I can decide what to fix now versus track for
  later instead of rediscovering issues ad hoc.

## Refresh — quality attributes §req:refresh-quality-attributes

- **Compatibility:** do not raise the SDK floor beyond what delivers a
  concrete benefit; preserve the widest consumer compatibility consistent
  with the upgraded tooling. The public Dart API stays unchanged unless a
  change is independently justified.
- **Maintainability:** the codebase is lint-clean under current rules, and
  analysis config carries no dead settings (e.g. the unmaintained
  `dart_code_metrics` block is removed or replaced with a maintained
  equivalent).
- **Security:** the native Swift ICMP engine is reviewed for unsafe socket
  use, out-of-bounds packet reads, and mishandling of untrusted inbound
  data.
- **Testability:** behavior changes and bug fixes in this pass land with
  tests; no test is left in a known-failing state.
- **Documentation quality:** docs are accurate and self-consistent across
  the root and both packages.

## Refresh — constraints §req:refresh-constraints

- Dependencies move to the **latest resolvable major** versions; if a major
  bump forces code changes (e.g. new lint rules), those changes are in
  scope.
- **Breaking changes are acceptable only when justified.** Raising the SDK
  floor or a dep major may force a new package major — that is fine when it
  buys a concrete benefit, but no break is introduced that "doesn't buy us
  anything."
- The SDK floor is set to the **lowest** stable version that the adopted
  tooling/features require — no speculative bump to match the installed
  toolchain.
- **No new CI/coverage-threshold infrastructure** is added in this pass;
  the testing goal is to fill gaps and fix known failures.
- The audit covers **both** the Dart code and the native Swift/iOS code.

## Refresh — priorities §req:refresh-priorities

- **Must-have:** dependencies current at latest resolvable majors;
  `analyze` clean; full `dart test` green with no known-failing cases; SDK
  floor bumped only as far as justified and documented; docs accurate to
  the shipped reality.
- **High priority:** an enumerated, triaged audit of bugs / security flaws
  / improvements across Dart and native Swift, with security-relevant Swift
  findings explicitly assessed; fixes applied for findings that are cheap
  and clearly correct.
- **Nice-to-have:** deeper test coverage beyond the obvious gaps; replacing
  the stale `dart_code_metrics` config with a maintained metrics/lint
  alternative.
